## A new way to make tutorials easier

Some applications allow you to show what keys are being pressed for the easy creation of tutorials. Some don't, and that's where this tool comes in! This aesthetically pleasing, transparent application can appear on top of any of your applications, and displays the left half of your keyboard as well as left and right clicks.
